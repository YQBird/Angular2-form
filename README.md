# Form
This is a project to build template driven from and reactive from using Angular 2.0. 
I did form validation in the third form using FormModule and ReactiveModule.

This project was generated with [angular-cli](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.0.0-beta.16.

## Development server
Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
